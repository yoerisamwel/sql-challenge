# sql-challenge
GWU bootcamp SQL project in which a relational database was designed and setup.

The week 9 GWU bootcamp assignment

This assignment was designed to implement the lessons we learned during the SQL section of the course. The project was centered around a dataset extracted from a fictional company. This dataset had to be organized in a relational database allowing us to analyze the data with SQL. 

I set up a Postgress database and designed the database in the quickdatabasediagrams program. Allowing me to map out how the database had to be set up and how the different tables were to be linked. There is one large table which contains most employee data. There were two other table types, one was a table used to join different tables together and one was a table with additional information (such as salaries and job titles).
Using key and foreign keys I joined the different tables together as shown in the diagram below:

I used this diagram and the datatypes drawn out here to write the SQL code to create the tables and setup the database. I wrote the analysis code in a separate SQL file. 

All in all, a very interesting project to work on. I have had some exposure to relational databases before but the process of thinking through how to set the database up and how tables would be related was very interesting. My go to language is python but see myself use SQL more often in the future for sure. As the easy to read syntax and select and run component strike me as very useful.
